You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

 

Example 1:

Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r

Example 2:

Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s

Example 3:

Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
Output: "apbqcd"
Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q 
merged: a p b q c   d

 

Constraints:

    1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100
    word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.

## Code Solution:

``` java
class Solution {
    public String mergeAlternately(String word1, String word2) {
        StringBuffer mergedStr=new StringBuffer();
        int n1=word1.length();  
        int n2=word2.length(); 
        int maxLength=Math.max(n1,n2);
        for(int i=0;i<maxLength;i++)
        {
            if(i<n1) mergedStr.append(word1.charAt(i));
            if(i<n2) mergedStr.append(word2.charAt(i));
        }
        return mergedStr.toString();
    }
}
```
- Better looping conditional checks - decrease tc
``` java
class Solution {
    public String mergeAlternately(String word1, String word2) {
        StringBuffer mergedString=new StringBuffer("");
        int minLength=Math.min(word1.length(),word2.length());
        for(int i=0;i<minLength;i++)
        {
            mergedString.append(word1.charAt(i));
            mergedString.append(word2.charAt(i));
        }
        if(word1.length()<word2.length()) 
            mergedString.append(word2.substring(word1.length(),word2.length()));
        else 
            mergedString.append(word1.substring(word2.length(),word1.length()));
        return mergedString.toString();
    }
}
```
